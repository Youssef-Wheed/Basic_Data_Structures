# üìö Data Structures in C ‚Äì Learning Repository

This repository contains implementations of foundational **Data Structures (DS)** written in the **C programming language**. Each folder is focused on a specific data structure and includes clear, minimal code to help you understand the logic and memory management techniques involved.

## üìÅ Folder Structure & Contents

Each folder in this repository represents a different data structure:

### `00 Array DS`
Basic operations using static arrays:
- Declare and initialize arrays
- Insert and delete elements at specific positions
- Search (linear and binary)
- Traverse and update elements

### `01 Stack DS Based On Array DS`
Stack implementation using arrays (LIFO behavior):
- Operations: `push()`, `pop()`, `peek()`
- Overflow and underflow handling
- Check if the stack is full or empty
- Ideal for expression parsing, backtracking, etc.

### `02 Linear Queue DS Based On Array DS`
Queue using arrays (FIFO behavior):
- `enqueue()` and `dequeue()` functions
- Maintains `front` and `rear` indexes
- Has a fixed capacity (static memory)
- Limit: space not reused after deletion

### `03 Circular Queue DS Based On Array DS`
Efficient queue using circular indexing:
- Solves linear queue‚Äôs space issue
- Uses `(rear + 1) % size` for wrap-around
- Operations: `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, `peek()`
- Ideal for buffering tasks

### `04 Linear Linked List DS`
Singly linked list using dynamic memory:
- Node structure with `data` and `next`
- Insert at beginning, end, or specific position
- Delete a node and traverse the list
- Dynamically allocated memory using `malloc()`

### `05 Linear Queue DS Based On Stack DS`
Queue implemented using two stacks:
- Simulates queue behavior using LIFO structures
- Uses two stacks: one for input, one for output
- Demonstrates algorithmic trick for order reversal
- Frequently asked in coding interviews
